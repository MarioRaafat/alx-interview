# Island Perimeter Project

This project includes a Python script that computes the perimeter of an island defined in a grid. The grid is a 2D list of integers where `0` represents water and `1` represents land. The goal is to calculate the perimeter of the island, assuming all cells are connected either horizontally or vertically.

## Requirements
- Python 3.4.3
- Files must be executable
- PEP 8 Style Guide (Version 1.7)
- No external imports allowed

## Files
- `0-island_perimeter.py`: Contains the `island_perimeter` function.
- `README.md`: This file provides information about the project.

## Usage
To run the function, use the following command:

```bash
./0-island_perimeter.py
